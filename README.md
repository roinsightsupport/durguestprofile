Here are just a few of the things that durguestprofile does well:

### Combine Guest Profile Data
Extract the following reports from Opera PMS, Profile Address for individual guests only.
This Sample code will join the following files into one reusable Excel workbook.

* use osr_landscape.osr to collect the guest profile data.

You can add as many as files and hotels in one folder.
You will be asked to choose the folder where all the above files are saved.
Final output will be 'FINAL_AUDIT_DATE.csv' file in same folder.
Warning: Do not change the csv file data structure.
Use this file to feed the Excel Template and start validating the output and
to update Power BI dashboards.

```
from durguestprofile import properties_score
